                Judge was born April 26, 1992 in Linden, California where he was adopted
                by Patty and Wayne Judge who were teachers. He grew up a San Francisco Giants
                fan and played multiple sports in high school. He played football, baseball,
                and basketball where he stood out in all the sports, setting records and receiving
                accolades in all of them. He was recruited to play Division 1 football at schools
                like Notre Dame, Stanford, and USC, but decided to stick with baseball, playing at
                Fresno State.

                leading to get promoted almost every year, until he eventually made it to the major leagues in 2016.

                Spring Training to show his talent playing against other major leaguers. He made his official MLB debut
                shortly after.

                Aaron made his MLB Debut on August 13, 2016 where he homered on his first at bat, and homered in his second
                start as well. He had a decent 2016, but in 2017, his Rookie Season, he started almost all the games
                and had a great season. He won Rookie of the Month 4 months in his rookie season and dominated, breaking 
                numerous Yankees records, and continuing to do so today. He won the Home Run Derby his rookie season as well,
                leading to the MLB Commissioner saying he could become the face of baseball. Aaron Judge is currently on pace
                to break the Single Season Home Run Record, and has been leading the MLB in almost all batting statistics, with
                the posibility of winning a Triple Crown, meaning he leads in Batting Average, Homeruns, and Runs Batted In. He is 
                entering Free Agency this offseason, meaning his new contract will also break records.
